# Exercise 4.1 Exploring currently running processes
## Using ps aux and top (and any other commands you feel would be useful), find out the total number of processes that are currently running. Identify the 10 most CPU-intensive processes and give a brief (one sentence) description of what each of them do. Hint: you can use ps aux | less to scroll through the list and man command to find out more about a command.
